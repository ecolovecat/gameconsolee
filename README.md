Use [w a s d] to move a "snake" around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food, and thereby grows larger. The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.

In this version, i improved the food. Now, it is not merely giving you points. By random mode render, you can choose [/ * -]
* [ / ] When you eat this, your length will be reduced half of ur current length, and receive 6 points.
* [ * ] When you eat this, you will receive 6 points.
* [ - ] When you eat this, your points will be reduced 10 points.

You need to pick mode to play. By clicking Enter and follow the .. is selected, you can choose the right mode. Since there is a few bugs with the changing color when you picking mode.
There are two mode:
* One player: You can play with a random word which is randomized automatically in our list.
You should guess the right answer within 7 turns. Or your character will be hung.
* Two player: Two people play with each other. The first person will type a word, and the guesser must guess that word. When type, the letter automatically change to **** so that the guesser cant see.
